*Part of the tico ecosystem* — https://www.ticoverse.com

**PicoDrive** is a Sega emulator by notaz, used here for the Sega 32X, with its SH-2 dynamic recompiler running on the Switch.

This fork adapts PicoDrive to work with the tico frontend and provides a standalone build for the Nintendo Switch, adding a small set of practical features while keeping the original experience familiar.

----------

## Summary

This fork focuses on making PicoDrive more usable in practice without changing its core purpose.

It adds:

-   Custom overlay matching tico design, including time, date, user avatar, and game title
-   Explicit control over display (integer scaling and aspect ratios)
-   Runtime-selectable rendering filters  
-   Built-in save and load state support
-   Integrated RetroAchievements with custom alerts
-   The SH-2 dynamic recompiler on the Switch, with its code cache executable from the binary's own code section

## A Note

A lot of work in this scene disappears over time — not because it lacked value, but because it was never shared.

If you are building something, consider releasing it. Even small contributions can help others move forward.
